# RPA-Challange-Blue-Prism
Blue Prism Object and Process for rpa challange (ver6.6)

Hello All!
This BPRelease file contains a solution for http://rpachallenge.com/

There may be a problem with th blueprism version. This bot is developed in ver6.6.
However, there is nothin on the project that concerns coordinates of the data items&stages etc. (If there was block-recover-resume structures, that would be a hug issue)
If you encounter this problem, just drag and organize the layout manually.
Contact me for any questions.
